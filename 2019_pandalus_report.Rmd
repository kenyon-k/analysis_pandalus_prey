### Setting Up Document Structure

This version is testing and learning how to ensure my local documents are updated to GitHub folloing a tutorial!

I will now be modifying this report, staging and commiting changes and then pushing to GitHub.

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph)

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance(miles)")
```

A summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))

```
